Geo Physical Imaging Final project - Seisimic methods 

In Geo Physical Imaging, there are several methods to scan the sub-surface of the ground. One of them is the Seismic method in which the seismic characteristics of the subsurface are estimated by reflected acoustics waves. Transmitter sends an acoustic wave and the receiver (Geophone) records the reflections.
